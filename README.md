# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"> Hi there, I'm Kevin Kipkoech

Software engineer. 5+ years under my belt. I work with Python, TypeScript, Go, and C with work covering web development, IoT, data, and AI/ML. 

I also dabble in software arcvhitecture, especially in the world of AWS. I have perfected the art of weighting tradeoffs such as consistency vs availability against each other. 

AI is my latest obsession. I consistently work with/on automation workflow integration. THink AI agents and RAG systems.
